## My process

### Built with

- HTML (Hyperlink Markup Language)
- CSS (for styles)

### What I learned

This project was an application of what I learned before ... So I didn't learn too much. I just tested my abilities.

By the way, I am so proud I learned the "@media screen and (max-width: 0px)" method :D

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  .container {
    width: 40%;
  }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 450px) {
  .container {
    width: 80%;
  }
}
```

### Useful resources

Umm ... I think I did everything by myself :D
... Oh, except for a question in the discord server which wasn't EVEN RESPONDED. So I won't count it
